                <p>At the peak of the <b>California Gold Rush</b> (1851-1952) just about anyone could pan <br>for gold; soon enough however the landscape had been so throughly stripped that <br>specialized tools were desperately needed to extract the element from riverbeds<br>and mountainsides. Swedish chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel in response<br> designed a blasting cap that would allow trained workers to strategically detonate<br> nitroglycerin cartridges and approved it for commercial use under the name â€˜dynamite.â€™</p> 

                <p>Nobel licensed his invention to the San Francisco merchant Julius Bandmann and in<br>  1867 the first explosives manufacturing firm in the United States known as the <b>Giant<br>  Powder Company</b> was established in the East Bay. Due to continual outcry about the<br>  environmental devastation they caused the factory relocated several times before<br>  being constructed on Fleming Point within what is now known as the Albany Bulb.</p> 
                
                <p>Workers at the plant accidentally ignited nitroglycerin on the morning of <b>July 9th, 1892</b> - <br> setting off a series of seven explosions that killed everyone on site instantly. Because<br> most employees at Giant Powder were Chinese immigrants, they were singled out in<br> the press as who to blame for the destruction of both the shoreline and the windows<br> of the UC Berkeley campus which all shattered from the force of the explosions.</p>
